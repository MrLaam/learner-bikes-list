# Learner Motorcycles DB :motorcycle:

Learner Motorcycles DB is a web app that allows users to explore and filter through a comprehensive list of all learner legal motorcycles available in the UK. It is powered by ASP.NET Core (5.0) and uses MSSQL for database storage. ~~It is currently still being developed~~ Edit: The site has now been deployed and will receive occasional minor updates, as well as updates to the database of motorcycles.

Here's a glimpse of an earlier iteration of the site above. Changing to a now white background allowed each bike image to be saved as .jpg instead of a clear background .png. This cut image hosting costs by nearly 50%!

The site is fully responsive on all devices, with consideration of horizontal and vertical landscapes. Best coding pracices have been adopted from clear variable naming to MVC structuring. The design was created via a high fidelity mockup in AdobeXD.
